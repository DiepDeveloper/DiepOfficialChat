Information Collected

By using this script, you agree that the following information may be collected and used **only for the chat functionality**. You may refuse to share your data; if you do, the chat will not display other users' messages. Your data will be sent over **secure HTTPS WebSocket servers** via the website https://diep.network/ and **will never be stored**.

Collected information includes:

- Discord ID
- Discord Username
- In-game Username
- Username Color
- Current Tank
- Current Level
- Presence on the website
- Current Game Mode

This information is collected from the official site https://diep.io/ and is used, among other things, to generate the last 100 chat messages while you are connected.
You may choose not to allow the storage of your information; in that case, the chat will appear empty on each page reload, and you will only see the messages you send during your session.
